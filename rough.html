  <h3>About Us</h3>
  <p>Bright Minds are experienced, qualified teachers who have come together to provide a stimulating and engaging learning environment for children in EYFS, Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2. As working teachers we have a good secure knowledge of the National Curriculum and the current educational affairs.</p>
  <p>The passion and love we have for teaching has motivated us to continue making a difference to the children. Our aim is for children to achieve a deep, clear understanding and reasoning of key concepts by learning the right skills. This will enable them to transfer these skills at school, ensuring they make consistent progress and attain their full potential. </p>

<div id ="tutor" class = "tabcontent">
  <h3>Why do you need a tutor?</h3>
  <p>Below we list key issues why your child would benefit from tutoring</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To ensure they fully understand key concepts</li>
    <li>To consolidate their learning</li>
    <li>To extend their learning</li>
    <li>To develop a growth mind-set</li>
    <li>To improve their learning capacity</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Every child is different and therefore learns in different ways. We teach your child using focused practices which can be difficult to apply in a large classroom environment, a lot more progress can be achieved in a short time. We consider the below to be an influential factor that play a major influence on a child’s development.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Confidence:</b> Children can have low confidence levels and this can be shown in class when they choose not to participate in activities or volunteer to contribute to class discussions. There is always a fear element of embarrassment which can then have a continued negative impact on their confidence levels.</li>
    <li><b>Focus:</b> Children at school can easily be distracted by their peers and then can find it difficult to concentrate in a challenging learning environment. Whilst big groups are good for social development, smaller groups inspire higher engagement levels where children are more focussed on the learning task as they have fewer distractions to manage. </li>
    <li><b>Pace:</b> Every child learns at a different pace. At school they learn at one pace which may be too slow or too fast for your child. Bright Minds provide opportunities for personalised learning enabling the children to learn at their own pace and progress in a positive way at the best speed for them.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What makes us different?</h3>
  <p>Our teaching style is different as we encourage children to take learning into their own hands, by guiding, prompting and teaching through the use of questions which scaffolds their learning.</p>

  <p>Bright Minds provides a positive and engaging learning environment where children are actively participating by exploring their learning through the use of practical resources. The children work in small groups (up to 4 children) where they are challenged, encouraged to ask questions and learn reflectively from each other.</p>

  <p>Bright Minds values each child and understands how important it is for their confidence and self esteem to be boosted.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>We set an example of a positive attitude when faced with challenges.</li>
    <li>We encourage the children to try new challenges.</li>
    <li>We give praises for their successes and celebrate these with the parents.</li>
    <li>We reassure children that any mistakes made are a crucial part of their overall learning process</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As we teach in smaller groups there are fewer distractions to be managed therefore promoting higher concentration levels. Within our interactive teaching using practical resources the children are always actively learning which allows them to stay focussed on the task.</p>

  <p>Our teaching pace is dependant on the children’s needs therefore we are flexible and regularly adapt and change the pace where necessary.</p>

  <p>Bright Minds consider motivation to be one of the key factors that impact on making progress and reaching the child’s full potential.</p>

<div id ="approach" class = "tabcontent">
  <h3>Teaching Approach?</h3>
  <p>Bright Minds equip the children in small groups to encourage, support and motivate each other by giving them the skills to cope with challenge and failure.</p>

  <p>Bright Minds teachers promote learning through teaching the National Curriculum objectives in an innovative, inspiring and practical way.</p>

  <p>We adopt the Building Learning Power (BLP) approach created by Professor Guy Claxton who believes that we are all capable of becoming better learners. BLP allows us to nurture this ethos and build the children’s learning power through a variety of strategies and techniques in our teaching.</p>

  <p>Professor Claxton suggests there are four main learning dispositions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Resilience- not giving up.</li>
    <li>Resourcefulness- –being able to use a range of learning strategies and knowing what to do when you get stuck.</li>
    <li>Reflectiveness- being able to think about yourself as a learner and how you might be able to do this better, </li>
    <li>Reciprocity- –being able to learn with and from others, as well as on your own. </li>
  </ul>


  <p>This supports Bright Mind’s vision of providing a practical framework for fostering lifelong learning in all young people. Therefore, not only do we teach children from an academic perspective but we embed a strong consistent learning culture.</p>

  <h3>Learning Groups</h3>
  <p>Classes are weekly, and children are taught in small groups (of up to 4 children). Classes are arranged so all children in a particular class are at a similar level and following similar specifications. These classes have all the advantages of an interactive environment - but are effective enough for children to receive plenty of individual attention. From our years of experience we have found they work very well and have proved extremely beneficial to many children’s who have made good progress.</p>

  <h3>Parent Partnership</h3>
  <p>Useful information for the parents about Bright Minds.</p>
</div>

<div id ="working" class = "tabcontent">
  <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
  <p>To begin the process, contact us to book an Initial Assessment.</p>
  <p>You will then be welcomed to complete the assessment with your child. A member of Bright Minds will guide you through the assessment and consultation process. During this time, the children will complete the assessment (under timed conditions). Although this will identify where the child is at, ongoing assessments will regularly take place throughout the term. </p>
  <p>This assessment is marked and recorded into our database, and used as a benchmark to inform us what learning band your child is working at and where their strengths and areas of development lie. This will then allow us to come up with individual targets for them to work towards in the lessons. The learning bands are determined by how well the children have met the relevant learning strand. The learning bands are categorised into 4 areas; emerging, developing, expected and exceeding.</p>
</div>

<div id ="reporting" class = "tabcontent">
  <h3>Reporting your child’s progress</h3>
  <p>We constantly strive to exceed the expectations of our parents.  After each session, you will be getting a verbal feedback on the child’s behaviour and learning. Here, at Bright Minds we will be completely honest with you. We will explain what has been taught, how you can support your child’s learning and what provisions we would like from you. We will be able to provide you with a framework indicating what topic areas we will be covering in that subject.</p>
</div>



<div id ="role" class = "tabcontent">
  <h3>The Role of Parents</h3>
  <p>In order to deliver the best results; Bright Minds recommend that after each session you take time to talk to your child and understand the learning that has taken place. This will help to consolidate their learning and will give you a clear idea of their progression. It will also identify any barriers or gaps that the child is facing, which you can feedback to us. We believe it is important for Bright Minds, parents and children to work towards a common goal together implementing an agreed strategy. Working alongside parents helps us to make sure that all children fulfil their potential.</p>
