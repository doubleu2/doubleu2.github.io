					  <h3>Bright Minds with a difference</h3>
					  <p>Being a small company, it enables us to maintain an engaging relationship between the children and parents. We strive to ensure children are learning the topics from the National Curriculum through practical means and developing key life skills which they will be able to transfer in school life.</p>
					</div>

					<div id ="choose" class = "tabcontent">
					  <h3>Why choose Bright Minds?</h3>
					  <ul>
					    <li>Professionally qualified teachers who are actively working in schools</li>
					    <li>Correct and secure knowledge of all the National Curriculum requirements</li>
					    <li>We provide personalised learning</li>
					    <li>Full awareness of all current and forthcoming educational affairs</li>
					    <li>All teaching provided complies with current school teaching techniques and methods</li>
					    <li>Fully DBS Certified </li>
					    <li>Level 1 safeguarding training</li>
					  </ul>
					</div>

					<div id ="different" class = "tabcontent">
					  <h3>What makes us different?</h3>
					  <p>Our teaching style is different as we encourage children to take learning into their own hands, by guiding, prompting and teaching through the use of questions which scaffolds their learning.</p>
					  <p>Bright Minds provides a positive and engaging learning environment where children are actively participating by exploring their learning through the use of practical resources. The children work in small groups (up to 4 children) where they are challenged, encouraged to ask questions and learn reflectively from each other.</p>
					  <p>Bright Minds values each child and understands how important it is for their confidence and self esteem to be boosted.</p>
					  <ul>
					    <li>We set an example of a positive attitude when faced with challenges.</li>
					    <li>We encourage the children to try new challenges.</li>
					    <li>We give praises for their successes and celebrate these with the parents.</li>
					    <li>We reassure children that any mistakes made are a crucial part of their overall learning process</li>
					  </ul>
					  <p>As we teach in smaller groups there are fewer distractions to be managed therefore promoting higher concentration levels. Within our interactive teaching using practical resources the children are always actively learning which allows them to stay focussed on the task.</p>
					  <p>Our teaching pace is dependant on the children’s needs therefore we are flexible and regularly adapt and change the pace where necessary.</p>
					  <p>Bright Minds consider motivation to be one of the key factors that impact on making progress and reaching the child’s full potential.</p>
					</div>

					<div id ="approach" class = "tabcontent">
					  <h3>Teaching Approach</h3>
					  <p>Bright Minds equip the children in small groups to encourage, support and motivate each other by giving them the skills to cope with challenge and failure.</p>
					  <p>Bright Minds teachers promote learning through teaching the National Curriculum objectives in an innovative, inspiring and practical way.</p>
					  <p>We adopt the Building Learning Power (BLP) approach created by Professor Guy Claxton who believes that we are all capable of becoming better learners. BLP allows us to nurture this ethos and build the children’s learning power through a variety of strategies and techniques in our teaching.</p>
					  <p>Professor Claxton suggests there are four main learning dispositions:</p>
					  <ul>
					    <li>Resilience- not giving up.</li>
					    <li>Resourcefulness- –being able to use a range of learning strategies and knowing what to do when you get stuck.</li>
					    <li>Reflectiveness- being able to think about yourself as a learner and how you might be able to do this better, </li>
					    <li>Reciprocity- –being able to learn with and from others, as well as on your own. </li>
					  </ul>
					  <p>This supports Bright Mind’s vision of providing a practical framework for fostering lifelong learning in all young people. Therefore, not only do we teach children from an academic perspective but we embed a strong consistent learning culture.</p>
